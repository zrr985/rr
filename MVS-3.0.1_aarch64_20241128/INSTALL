Installation Guide for Client Software Suite for Linux x86 and ARM

Installation of the Client Software Suite
=======================================================

To install the Client Software Suite for Linux, you need the
correct installation package for your architecture. We provide packages
for x86, x86_64, armhf and arm64.

This installation guide assumes that you are going to install the
Client Software Suite to the /opt/Client directory and that
you have already extracted the Client-x.y.z_<ARCH>_<ReleaseDate>.tar.gz archive
to your home directory. 

Note: Root permissions are needed to write to /opt.

To install the Client Software Suite in /opt/Client
follow these steps:

  1. Change to the directory which contains this INSTALL file, e.g.:
       cd ~/Client-x.y.z-<ARCH>

  2. Execute the installer script
       ./setup.sh

  3. Execute /opt/Client/bin/Client to test your cameras.

The Client-x.y.z_<ARCH>_<ReleaseDate>.tar.gz package contains the following files:
Client_<ARCH>.tar.gz                # Client, SDK and runtime files, sample files
